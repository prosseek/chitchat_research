## Message and Context

For this simulation, Context is represented as a message with "context" tag with it. 

### Id of a message
(???) Each message has an id (from the getId() method). The messages are stored in a dictionary of `id -> message` in the channel. 

    public abstract class MessageRouter {
        private HashMap<String, Message> messages; 
        
### Sending messages

(???) Sending message is three step work:

1. Create message object: `Message m1 = new Message(host1, host2, getId(host1, host2, size1), size1);`
2. Set property to the message: `m1.addProperty("type", "context"); m1.setAppID(APP_ID);`
3. Host creates the message: `host1.createNewMessage(m1);`
    * This stores the message in the channel.

When simulation updates itself, the stored message in the buffer is sent. 

#### Removing a message in a channel

So, when a message is delivered, the message in the sender should be removed. 
In real world, there is no way of knowing if the message is delivered, but in simulation we can just do it. (This will make the simulation easier to implement.)

## When connections are up and down

hostsConnected/Disconnected methods are invoked. (Make sure your application implements the ConnectionListener)

    @Override
    public void hostsConnected(DTNHost host1, DTNHost host2) {
    public void hostsDisconnected(DTNHost host1, DTNHost host2) {
        
## When messages are done sending

messageTranserred methods are invoked (make sure it implements MessageListener)

    @Override
    public void messageTransferred(Message m, DTNHost from, DTNHost to, boolean firstDelivery)
    
Also, application's `handle(Message msg, DTNHost host)` method is invoked, I think we can just use this method. 

    public Message handle(Message msg, DTNHost host) {
