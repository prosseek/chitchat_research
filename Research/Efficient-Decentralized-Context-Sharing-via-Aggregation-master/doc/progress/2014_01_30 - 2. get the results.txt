## Goal

Now, we have the results from `massiveSimulate.py` for the case mesh10* files in testSampleDirectory.  

    pattern = os.path.join(testSampleDirectory, "mesh10*.txt")
    a,s,c = runMassiveSimulation(pattern, singleOnly=False)
    print a
    print s
    print c

The result is a/s/c (accuracy, speed, count) and generated time stamp with the condition when the results are made

	2014-01-30 10:56:02
	_mesh10*.txt True
	10.0,10.0,0.0,0.0
	3.0
	166.0,0.0
	
I need to get the values, and I need to process these values to make Excel spread sheets. 


## Action Items

1. Create all the patterns for
	1. For tree mesh (x2)
	2. For each pattern (10 .. 100) (x 10)
	3. For singleOnly or not (x2)

So we have 40 simulations for 100 graphs: 4000 in total.

The result will be recorded in

	Name True/False <-- singleOnly
	Results in asc format
	Blank
	...
	
OK. Started the massive simulation at [2014/01/30] 11:01am.
