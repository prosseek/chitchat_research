## Plan
### [2016/04/04]12:52PM Support Special type.
We need to support the type that represents the dictionary type.

## Finished

### [2016/03/31]07:45PM

In `util.types.TypeInference`, it inferences the value from the system
provided types, but it should be expanded to support user defined types.

#### Implemented
1. User can choose among range/encoding/string/float type value.
